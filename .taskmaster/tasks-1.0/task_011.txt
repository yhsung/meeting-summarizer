# Task ID: 11
# Title: Setup Comprehensive Testing Framework and CI/CD
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement complete testing suite with automated CI/CD pipeline and coverage reporting
# Details:
Setup comprehensive testing framework using flutter_test with minimum 80% code coverage. Implement unit tests for all services using mockito ^5.4.4 for mocking dependencies. Create widget tests with golden file regression testing using golden_toolkit ^0.15.0. Setup integration tests using integration_test package for end-to-end workflows. Create mock services for AudioRecordingService, WhisperApiService, DatabaseHelper, and CloudSyncService. Implement GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline with matrix testing for iOS, Android, and web platforms. Add automated code coverage reporting using codecov, code quality analysis using very_good_analysis ^6.0.0, and automated testing on PR validation. Setup test data factories using faker ^2.1.0 for comprehensive test scenarios.

# Test Strategy:
Verify all tests pass in CI/CD pipeline, confirm coverage meets 80% minimum, validate golden file tests catch UI regressions, test mock services accurately simulate real behavior
