# Task ID: 4
# Title: Integrate OpenAI Whisper API Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement Whisper API integration with proper authentication, error handling, and fallback mechanisms
# Details:
Create WhisperApiService using http ^1.2.2 with OpenAI Whisper API v1 integration. Implement secure API key storage using flutter_secure_storage. Add support for multiple languages with auto-detection and manual selection. Implement confidence scoring, speaker identification, and custom vocabulary support. Add rate limiting using rate_limiter ^0.1.0, exponential backoff for retries, and comprehensive error handling. Create offline fallback using whisper_dart package for local Whisper model deployment. Implement chunked audio processing for large files and real-time transcription with streaming support. Add usage monitoring and quota management.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test API service methods with mock HTTP client, integration test with real Whisper API, test offline transcription capability, verify error handling and retry mechanisms, test rate limiting behavior

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design API Service Architecture [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a modular API service architecture for Whisper integration with proper abstraction layers
### Details:
Design service layer with interfaces for audio processing, implement repository pattern for API calls, create configuration management for different Whisper API endpoints, establish proper separation of concerns between API client and business logic

## 2. Implement Secure Authentication and Key Management [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Set up secure API key management and authentication mechanisms for Whisper API access
### Details:
Implement secure storage for API keys using environment variables or secure vaults, create authentication middleware for API requests, implement token refresh mechanisms if needed, add validation for API credentials

## 3. Build Multi-Language Support Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Implement comprehensive multi-language support for audio transcription with language detection
### Details:
Create language detection service, implement language-specific transcription parameters, build language mapping for supported languages, create UI components for language selection, implement automatic language detection fallback

## 4. Develop Offline Fallback with Local Whisper [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Implement local Whisper model integration as fallback when API is unavailable
### Details:
Integrate local Whisper model installation, create fallback detection mechanism, implement local processing pipeline, handle model downloads and updates, create seamless switching between API and local processing

## 5. Build Error Handling and Retry Mechanisms [done]
### Dependencies: 4.2, 4.4
### Description: Create comprehensive error handling with intelligent retry logic and graceful degradation
### Details:
Implement exponential backoff retry strategy, create error classification system, build circuit breaker pattern for API failures, implement graceful degradation to offline mode, create comprehensive error logging and user feedback

## 6. Implement Usage Monitoring Systems [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.5
### Description: Create monitoring and analytics system for tracking API usage, performance metrics, and system health
### Details:
Build API usage tracking and rate limiting, implement performance monitoring for transcription times, create health check endpoints, implement cost tracking for API usage, build dashboard for monitoring system metrics and user analytics
