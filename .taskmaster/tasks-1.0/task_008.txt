# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Cloud Synchronization Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create cloud sync functionality with multiple providers and conflict resolution
# Details:
Implement CloudSyncService supporting iCloud Drive (using icloud_storage), Google Drive API (using googleapis ^13.2.0), OneDrive (using onedrive_api), and Dropbox (using dropbox_client ^0.7.0). Create unified interface for all cloud providers with automatic provider detection based on platform. Implement conflict resolution strategies: last-write-wins, user-prompted resolution, and automatic merging for non-conflicting changes. Add incremental sync to minimize data transfer and sync status indicators. Implement end-to-end encryption using encrypt ^5.0.3 before cloud upload. Add offline queue for sync operations and automatic retry mechanisms with exponential backoff.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test cloud service interfaces, integration test with real cloud providers, test conflict resolution scenarios, verify encryption/decryption, test offline sync queue functionality

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design unified cloud sync service architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the core service architecture and interfaces for cloud synchronization
### Details:
Define abstract interfaces, service contracts, and architectural patterns for the unified cloud sync system. Establish common data models and communication protocols.

## 2. Implement iCloud provider integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Develop iCloud-specific implementation of the cloud sync interface
### Details:
Implement iCloud Drive API integration, authentication, file operations, and metadata handling according to the unified service architecture.

## 3. Implement Google Drive provider integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Develop Google Drive-specific implementation of the cloud sync interface
### Details:
Implement Google Drive API integration, OAuth authentication, file operations, and metadata handling according to the unified service architecture.

## 4. Implement OneDrive and Dropbox provider integrations [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Develop OneDrive and Dropbox-specific implementations of the cloud sync interface
### Details:
Implement OneDrive and Dropbox API integrations, authentication flows, file operations, and metadata handling according to the unified service architecture.

## 5. Build conflict resolution system [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2, 8.3, 8.4
### Description: Create system to detect and resolve synchronization conflicts

Implement conflict detection algorithms, resolution strategies, version management, and user conflict resolution interfaces for handling file conflicts across providers.

## 6. Implement incremental sync mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2, 8.3, 8.4
### Description: Develop efficient incremental synchronization with change tracking
### Details:
Create change detection, delta synchronization, file chunking, and efficient transfer mechanisms to minimize bandwidth usage and sync time.

## 7. Implement end-to-end encryption system [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.5, 8.6
### Description: Add encryption layer for secure cloud synchronization
### Details:
Implement client-side encryption, key management, secure metadata handling, and encrypted file operations while maintaining sync functionality.

## 8. Build offline queue management and retry systems [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.7
### Description: Create offline operation queueing and automatic retry mechanisms
### Details:
Implement offline operation queuing, automatic retry logic, exponential backoff, network state monitoring, and queue persistence across application restarts.
