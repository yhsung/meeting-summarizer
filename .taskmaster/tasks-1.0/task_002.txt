# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Audio Recording Service
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create cross-platform audio recording service with real-time waveform display and multiple format support
# Details:
Implement AudioRecordingService using record ^5.1.2 and audio_waveforms ^1.0.5 packages. Create platform-specific implementations for iOS (AVAudioRecorder), Android (MediaRecorder), and desktop (native audio APIs). Support WAV, MP3, M4A formats with quality selection (high: 44.1kHz/16-bit, medium: 22kHz/16-bit, low: 8kHz/8-bit). Implement real-time waveform visualization using custom painters. Add pause/resume functionality, recording time limits, and background recording support using background_task package. Integrate noise reduction using flutter_audio_processing. Handle microphone permissions using permission_handler ^11.3.1.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test AudioRecordingService methods, widget test waveform display component, integration test recording workflow with different formats and quality settings, test background recording on mobile platforms

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and implement core audio service architecture [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundational audio service architecture with proper abstraction layers for cross-platform compatibility
### Details:
Implement abstract audio service interfaces, service factory patterns, and core audio session management. Define consistent APIs for recording operations across platforms.

## 2. Implement platform-specific audio recording engines [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Develop native audio recording implementations for iOS, Android, and web platforms
### Details:
Create platform-specific implementations using AVAudioRecorder (iOS), MediaRecorder (Android), and MediaRecorder API (Web). Handle platform-specific audio session configurations and hardware access.

## 3. Implement audio format and quality management system [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Create comprehensive audio format handling with quality control and codec management
### Details:
Support multiple audio formats (MP3, AAC, WAV, M4A), implement quality presets (low, medium, high), codec selection based on platform capabilities, and file size optimization strategies.

## 4. Build real-time waveform visualization component [done]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Develop real-time audio waveform visualization with performance optimization
### Details:
Implement audio level monitoring, real-time waveform rendering using canvas or native graphics, audio buffer processing for visualization data, and smooth animation with 60fps target.

## 5. Implement background recording capabilities [done]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Enable continuous audio recording in background with proper lifecycle management
### Details:
Handle app backgrounding scenarios, implement background audio sessions, manage iOS background app refresh, Android foreground services, and web page visibility API integration.

## 6. Integrate noise reduction and audio enhancement [done]
### Dependencies: 2.3
### Description: Implement audio processing features for noise reduction and quality enhancement
### Details:
Integrate noise suppression algorithms, echo cancellation, automatic gain control, and audio filtering. Support both real-time and post-processing enhancement modes.

## 7. Implement comprehensive audio permission handling [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Create robust permission management system for microphone access across platforms
### Details:
Handle microphone permission requests, permission status monitoring, graceful degradation when permissions denied, permission re-request flows, and platform-specific permission UI integration.
