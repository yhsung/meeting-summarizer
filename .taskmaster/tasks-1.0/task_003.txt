# Task ID: 3
# Title: Setup Local Database and Data Models
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement SQLite database schema and data models for recordings, transcriptions, and user settings
# Details:
Create database schema using sqflite ^2.3.3 with tables: recordings (id, filename, duration, format, created_at, updated_at), transcriptions (id, recording_id, text, confidence, language, created_at), summaries (id, transcription_id, content, type, created_at), settings (key, value). Implement DatabaseHelper class with CRUD operations, database migrations, and data validation. Create data models: Recording, Transcription, Summary, AppSettings with JSON serialization using json_annotation ^4.9.0. Implement encrypted storage for sensitive data using flutter_secure_storage ^9.2.2. Add database indexing for search performance and foreign key constraints for data integrity.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test all database operations, test data model serialization/deserialization, verify database migrations work correctly, test encrypted storage functionality, performance test with large datasets

# Subtasks:
## 1. Database schema design and table creation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design the database schema structure and create necessary tables for the application
### Details:
Define table structures, relationships, constraints, and create SQL scripts for table creation. Include considerations for data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and indexes.

## 2. Data model classes with serialization [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Implement data model classes with proper serialization and deserialization methods
### Details:
Create model classes that represent database entities, implement JSON serialization/deserialization, validation methods, and type safety for data handling.

## 3. Database helper class with CRUD operations [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2
### Description: Build a database helper class providing comprehensive CRUD operations
### Details:
Implement database connection management, create/read/update/delete operations, query builders, transaction handling, and error management for all database interactions.

## 4. Migration system implementation [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create a database migration system for schema versioning and updates

## 6. Performance optimization with indexing [done]
### Dependencies: 3.3, 3.4
### Description: Optimize database performance through strategic indexing and query optimization
### Details:
Analyze query patterns, create appropriate indexes, implement query optimization strategies, benchmark performance, and establish monitoring for database performance metrics.
