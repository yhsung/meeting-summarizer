# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement AI Summarization Engine
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create AI-powered summarization service with multiple summary types and customizable options
# Details:
Implement SummarizationService using OpenAI GPT-4 API with gpt-4-turbo-preview model. Create multiple summary types: bullet points, executive summary, key highlights, action items, and meeting notes with timestamps. Implement customizable summary length (short: 100-200 words, medium: 200-500 words, long: 500+ words) and focus areas. Add topic extraction using natural language processing, keyword identification, and action item detection. Implement meeting notes formatting with speaker identification and timestamp correlation. Create prompt engineering templates for different summary types and use cases. Add summary quality scoring and user feedback integration.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test summarization logic with mock transcription data, test different summary types and lengths, verify topic extraction accuracy, integration test with real transcription data, test prompt template effectiveness

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design core service architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundational architecture for the summarization engine with proper separation of concerns and extensibility
### Details:
Design the main service classes, interfaces, and dependency injection patterns. Define the core summarization pipeline with input validation, processing stages, and output formatting. Establish error handling and logging mechanisms.

## 2. Implement multiple summary type implementations [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Build different summary types (executive, detailed, action items, key points) with configurable parameters
### Details:
Create separate summary generators for each type with specific formatting rules and content focus. Implement strategy pattern for summary type selection and configuration options for length, detail level, and focus areas.

## 3. Develop prompt engineering and template system [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Create a flexible prompt template system for different AI models and summary types
### Details:
Design prompt templates with variable substitution, context injection, and model-specific optimizations. Implement template management system with version control and A/B testing capabilities for prompt effectiveness.

## 4. Build topic extraction and keyword identification [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Implement natural language processing for automatic topic detection and key term extraction
### Details:
Integrate NLP libraries for named entity recognition, topic modeling, and keyword extraction. Create algorithms for relevance scoring and topic clustering with configurable sensitivity parameters.

## 5. Create meeting notes formatting with timestamps [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2, 5.4
### Description: Develop timestamp-aware formatting system for meeting transcripts and structured note output
### Details:
Build timestamp parsing and synchronization logic for meeting recordings. Create structured output formats with speaker identification, time-based navigation, and action item extraction with deadlines.

## 6. Implement quality scoring with feedback integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2, 5.3
### Description: Create quality assessment metrics and user feedback system for continuous improvement
### Details:
Develop scoring algorithms for summary quality including coherence, completeness, and accuracy metrics. Build feedback collection system with rating mechanisms and iterative improvement based on user input.
