- Verified backward compatibility while fixing CI pipeline

### **5. Android Build Configuration**

**Problem Solved**: Android build issues with flutter_local_notifications

**Files Modified**:
- `meeting_summarizer/android/app/build.gradle.kts`

**Technical Solution**:
- Added core library desugaring support
- Added `coreLibraryDesugaring("com.android.tools:desugar_jdk_libs:2.0.4")` dependency
- Enabled `isCoreLibraryDesugaringEnabled = true`
