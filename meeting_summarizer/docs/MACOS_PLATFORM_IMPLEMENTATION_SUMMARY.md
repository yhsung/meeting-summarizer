## Architecture and Design

### Service Integration Pattern

The macOS platform service follows the established pattern from the iOS implementation:

```dart
// Service hierarchy
MacOSPlatformService
├── MacOSMenuBarService (existing)
├── Platform Channel Communication
├── Spotlight Search Management
├── Dock Integration
├── Touch Bar Control
├── Notification Management
├── Services Menu Handler
├── Global Hotkey Manager
└── File Association Handler
```

### State Management

- Centralized state tracking for recording and transcription status
- Coordinated updates across all macOS integrations
- Callback-based event handling for platform actions
- Resource lifecycle management

### Native Integration

- Swift-based AppDelegate with comprehensive method channel handling
- Info.plist configuration for system integration
- Platform-specific feature detection and availability checking
- Graceful fallback for unsupported features

## Usage Examples

### Basic Integration

```dart
final macosService = MacOSPlatformService();

// Initialize all macOS platform features
await macosService.initialize();

// Update all integrations with current app state
await macosService.updateIntegrations({
  'isRecording': true,
  'meetingTitle': 'Team Standup',
  'recordingDuration': Duration(minutes: 5),
});

// Handle platform-specific actions
macosService.onPlatformAction = (action, parameters) {
  switch (action) {
    case 'start_recording':
      // Handle recording start from dock/menu bar/Touch Bar
      break;
    case 'view_recordings':
      // Navigate to recordings view
      break;
  }
};
```

### Spotlight Integration

```dart
// Index a recording for Spotlight search
await macosService.indexRecordingForSpotlight(
  recordingId: 'meeting-001',
  title: 'Team Standup - March 15',
  transcript: 'Discussion about project progress...',
  createdAt: DateTime.now(),
  duration: Duration(minutes: 30),
  keywords: ['standup', 'team', 'progress'],
);

// Handle search results
macosService.onSpotlightSearch = (query, userInfo) {
  // Navigate to search results or specific recording
};
```

### Notification Integration

```dart
// Show completion notification with actions
await macosService.showRecordingCompleteNotification(
  recordingId: 'meeting-001',
  title: 'Team Standup',
  duration: Duration(minutes: 30),
);

// Handle notification actions
macosService.onNotificationAction = (notificationId, actionId) {
  if (actionId == 'view_recording') {
    // Open recording view
  } else if (actionId == 'transcribe_now') {
    // Start transcription
  }
};
```
